<div class="entry-content"><p>AIX（高级交互执行，发音）是一系列由IBM开发和销售的几个计算机平台的专有的Unix操作系统。最初发布的IBM 6150 RISC工作站，AIX支持或支持各种各样的硬件平台，包括IBM RS/6000系列，后来IBM POWER和PowerPC为基础的系统，IBM的System i的System/370大型机，PS / 2个人电脑，苹果网络服务器。AIX是基于4.3BSD兼容扩展的UNIX系统V。这是目前由The Open Group的UNIX 03标准认证的4个商业化的操作系统之一。（其他人是Mac OS X的Solaris和HP-UX）。</p>

<p>AIX操作系统家族于1986年首次亮相，成为了标准的RS/6000系列于1990年推出的操作系统，IBM还积极开发。它是目前支持IBM的Power系统上的IBM i和Linux的一起。AIX操作系统是第一个利用日志文件系统，和IBM不断提高的软件的功能，如处理器，磁盘和网络虚拟化，动态硬件资源分配（包括小数处理器单元），从它的主机设计和可靠性工程移植</p>

<p>1历史</p>

<p>AIX版本1，在1986年推出的IBM 6150 RT工作站，是基于UNIX系统V第1版和2。在开发AIX，IBM和互动系统公司（IBM签约）还包括4.2和4.3 BSD UNIX的源代码。</p>

<p>在其他的变种，后来IBM AIX版本3（也称为AIX/6000），System V的第3版，IBM POWER基于RS/6000平台的基础上产生的。自1990年以来，AIX曾作为主操作系统的RS/6000系列（后更名为IBM的eServer p系列，IBM的System p，现在的IBM Power Systems）。AIX版本4，于1994年推出，RS/6000 SMP服务器第一个引进的对称多处理，通过20世纪90年代继续发展，最终在1999年与AIX 4.3.3。4.1版，在略作修改的形式，也是苹果网络服务器系统的销售，以配合苹果电脑的Macintosh上线的标准操作系统。</p>

<p>在20世纪90年代后期，在项目蒙特雷，IBM和Santa Cruz Operation公司计划整合成一个单一的32位/64位的多平台UNIX AIX和UnixWare的，特别强调英特尔IA-64（安腾）架构的CPU上运行。IA-64系统是一个beta测试版本的AIX 5L公布，但根据公布的文件在SCO诉IBM的诉讼，不到40个许可证卖的成品蒙特利UNIX的在2002年之前，该项目被终止。在2003年，SCO集团声称（其他违法行为之间），IBM挪用纳入AIX，SCO UNIX系统V第4版许可的源代码，随后撤回了IBM的许可，用以开发和分发AIX。IBM认为，他们的许可证是不可撤销的，继续销售和支持产品，直到被宣判的诉讼。</p>

<p>AIX是一个组成部分，2003年SCO诉IBM的诉讼，其中IBM，SCO集团提起诉讼，指控IBM对Linux的代码库贡献了SCO的知识产权。SCO集团，谁认为他们是合法的版权拥有人，涵盖了Unix的操作系统，试图撤销IBM的出售或分发AIX操作系统的许可证。在2010年3月，一个陪审团裁定，发现的Novell，而不是SCO集团，旗下拥有的权利为Unix。</p>

<p>AIX 6在2007年5月宣布，从2007年6月至2007年11月9日的一般可用性（GA）的AIX 6.1跑了公测。在AIX 6.1的主要新功能包括：基于角色的访问控制，工作负载分区（这使应用程序迁移），增强的安全性（添加NFS v3和v4的AES加密类型）和实时分区迁移功能的POWER6硬件。</p>

<p>2010年4月，IBM发布公告即将到来的7.1版本。计划支持继续POWER4代或更高版本的硬件。一些新的功能，包括更好的可扩展性，增强了集群和管理能力也被提及。作为WPAR能够运行老版本的AIX会继续使用5.2的硬件不支持的机会。IBM拟7.1提供一个开放的Beta测试计划。</p>

<p>2支持的硬件平台</p>

<p>2.1 IBM 6150 RT</p>

<p>原来的AIX（有时也被称为AIX / RT）开发的IBM 6150 RT工作站由IBM的结合与互动系统公司 ，谁曾移植的UNIX系统III的IBM PC IBM PC / IX。 安装介质包括8个1.2M的软盘 。 RT为基础的的ROMP 微处理器 ，第一个商用RISC芯片。 这是基于一个设计，率先在IBM研究中心（ IBM 801 ）。</p>

<p>RT设计新颖的方面之一是使用一个微内核 ，虚拟资源管理器（VRM）。 所有控制由一个微内核的键盘，鼠标，显示器，硬盘驱动器和网络。 人们可以从一个操作系统下使用的Alt-Tab组合键“热键”。 每个OS反过来会得到藏的键盘，鼠标和显示器。 除了AIX V2， PICK OS还利用微内核。</p>

<p>AIX V2内核的编写PL / I编程语言，这证明了在迁移到AIX V3的麻烦[ 引用 ] AIX V2包含完整的TCP / IP网络，以及SNA和两个网络文件系统NFS授权的Sun微系统 ， 分布式服务 （DS）。 DS有正在建造的SNA上的区别，从而完全兼容DS在IBM中端AS/400和大型机系统。 对于图形用户界面，AIX V2是从MIT的X10R3，后来在的X10R4和X11版本的X Window系统 ，连同雅典娜widget集 。 为的Fortran和C编译器。 其中一个比较流行的桌面应用程序是在PageMaker的 桌面出版软件。</p>

<p>2.2 IBM PS / 2系列</p>

<p>AIX PS / 2上运行虚拟PC</p>

<p>根据合同，IBM AIX PS / 2（也称为AIX/386） 轨迹Computing公司开发的。 AIX PS / 2，首次发布于1989年， 英特尔386和兼容的处理器上运行的IBM PS / 2 个人电脑</p>

<p>2.3 IBM大型机</p>

<p>在1988年，IBM宣布AIX/370，还开发了轨迹计算。 AIX/370是IBM的第三次尝试提供类似Unix的功能，他们的大型机线，具体的System/370 （以前的版本是一个TSS/370基于Unix系统的联合开发与AT＆T c.1980和VM / IX一个VM/370系统共同开发的互动系统公司 c.1984）。 AIX/370发布于1990年与功能等价的System V Release 2和4.3BSD以及IBM的增强。 通过引入的ESA/390架构，AIX/370 AIX / ESA于1991年，是基于OSF / 1 ，被替换的System/390平台上也跑了。 这种发展的努力，部分允许IBM与阿姆达尔 UTS竞争。[ 需要的引证 ]与AIX/370，AIX / ESA本身作为主机操作系统，并作为下一个客人VM运行。 AIX / ESA，虽然在技术上是先进的，几乎没有商业上的成功，部分原因是因为UNIX功能被添加到现有的主机操作系统作为一个选项， MVS ，在1999年成为MVS / ESA OpenEdition的 。</p>

<p>2.4 POWER / PowerPC为基础的系统</p>

<p>此次发布的AIX版本3（有时称为AIX/6000）正好与1990年公布的第一个的POWER1基于IBM RS/6000型号。 RS/6000是独一无二的，它不是只在整数运算性能优于所有其他机器，但也打了10倍的浮点性能的竞争。[ 需要的引证 ]的竞争，从供应商的Sun的Unix工作站 ， HP和SGI ，以及在较小的程度，来自鹰图及其他。 这些机器都大致相若，零售价格范围在1万美元到10万美元，并提供相似数量的内存，磁盘和网络，大致相当于图形子系统。 浮点单元的新颖之处是，它被捆绑到整数流水线，并进行了单次乘加指令周期（更准确地说是一个3循环的深流水线，3个周期）。 的共同智慧的时代，只有整数运算性能重要的，奇怪很少有人的事实，许多客户正在运行的浮点密集型数字的科学计算工作负载。</p>

<p>发布的AIX版本3还利用了在POWER架构的发展。</p>

<p>AIX V3的几种方式在软件方面的创新。 这是第一个操作系统的思想引入一个日志文件系统 ， JFS ，允许快速启动时间，避免了磁盘上的文件系统（看到的fsck ）在每次重新启动，以确保一致性。 另一项技术革新，从而避免了静态链接库的应用程序需要的共享库 。 由此产生的更小的二进制文件使用较少的RAM的硬件上运行，并使用更少的磁盘空间来安装。 除了提高性能，这是一个福音，开发人员可以在几十千字节兆字节的静态链接到C库的可执行文件，而不是一个可执行的二进制文件。 AIX V3还取消了微内核的AIX V2，是一个有争议的举动，导致在v3不包含PL / I代码和更“纯”比V2。</p>

<p>其他著名的子系统包括：</p>

<p>IRIS GL ，3D渲染库， OpenGL的的祖先。 IRIS GL是由IBM授权的SGI于1987年，仍然是一个小公司已售出的只有千台机器。 SGI还提供了低端显卡的RS/6000，能够吸引20000 高洛德阴影的三角形每秒。 高端显卡的设计是由IBM，后续的基于大型机的IBM 5080 ，能够使每秒990,000载体。</p>

<p>PHIGS ，另一个3D渲染API，在汽车CAD / CAM圈的，在CATIA的核心。</p>

<p>全面实施，连同母题的建议的窗口小部件收集和窗口管理器的X Window系统版本11 。</p>

<p>网络文件系统NFS从太阳 AFS， Andrew文件系统 ，以及DFS， 分布式文件系统 。</p>

<p>NCS， 网络计算系统 ，授权的阿波罗电脑 （后来被HP ）。</p>

<p>DPS屏幕上的显示系统。 这是作为一个“B计划”的情况下显着X11 +母题的组合，在市场上失败。 然而，这是高度专用的，仅支持由Sun， NeXT公司 ，以及IBM。 这巩固了其在市场上的开放式系统的挑战X11 + Motif和其3D能力的缺乏面对失败。</p>

<p>截至2011年，AIX上运行的System i ， System p系列 ， IBM 电源的System p5，System i5的的eServer P5，eServer pSeries服务器和eServer i5服务器产品线，以及IBM 的BladeCenter刀片服务器基于Power Architecture技术。</p>

<p>2.4.1 POWER7 AIX特点</p>

<p>增强型RISC（POWER）第7版的性能优化使AIX操作系统的一个独特的性能优势。 POWER7提供了新的功能，使用多个内核和多个CPU线程，创建一个池的虚拟CPU。 典型的IBM POWER7处理器的8个核心，每个核心四线程，总容量为32个并发线程，每个处理器电路或32个虚拟CPU，同时还可以使用相同的电力消耗，POWER6处理器的电路，它只能支持8个虚拟CPU。 ，AIX可以利用POWER7的顺序，而不是按顺序执行指令的能力，利用POWER7的积极的的订单指令集驱动高效利用可用的执行路径。</p>

<p>AIX 7包含一个新的内置称为群集感知型AIX集群功能。 AIX是能够组织多个LPAR通过多路径的通信信道到邻近的CPU，从而实现非常高速的处理器之间的通信。 这使得多TB的内存地址范围和页表的访问，以支持全球PB级的共享的内存空间，使AIX POWER7集群的软件开发人员可以编写一个集群，如果它是一个单一的系统，不使用消息传递（即信号控制间进程通信）。 AIX系统管理员可以使用此新功能的AIX节点的集群池。 默认情况下，，AIX V7.1针内核内存和支持，允许应用程序到脚的内核堆栈。 钢钉内核的内存和内核堆栈的实时性要求的应用，可以提供性能改进，确保不分页的内核内存和内核堆栈的应用程序。</p>

<p>AIX POWER7系统包括Active Memory扩展功能，从而增加了系统的灵活性，系统管理员可以配置逻辑分区（LPAR）使用更少的物理内存。 例如，一个LPAR运行AIX OS应用程序配置80 GB的物理内存，但硬件却仅消耗60 GB的物理内存。 Active Memory扩展使用的内存压缩技术，可以透明地压缩在内存中的数据，从而使更多的数据放入内存，从而扩大POWER7系统的内存容量。 利用Active Memory扩展可以提高系统的利用率，增加系统的吞吐量。 AIX 7会自动管理内存的大小自动使用4K，64K或结合这些页面大小的页面。 这种自我调节功能最佳的系统性能没有管理的努力..</p>

<p>2.4.2苹果网络服务器</p>

<p>苹果网络服务器系统是由苹果电脑公司设计的基于PowerPC的系统有众多高端功能，苹果的硬件不标准，包括热插拔硬盘，冗余电源和外部监控功能。 这些系统都或多或少的基础上的Power Macintosh硬件时可用，但被设计为使用本机操作系统中的一个特殊版本的特定的ANS AIX（版本4.1.4或4.1.5）。</p>

<p>AIX是唯一兼容的网络服务器，并没有移植到标准的Power Macintosh硬件。 为了不被混淆的是A / UX ，苹果公司的68K基于Macintosh的早期版本的Unix 。</p>

<p>2.4.3 IA-64系统</p>

<p>项目蒙特利的一部分，IBM发布了一个beta测试版本的AIX 5L的IA-64（ 安腾 ）架构，在2001年，但从来没有成为正式的产品由于缺乏兴趣。</p>
